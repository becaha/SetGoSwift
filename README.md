Set Go

I liked being able to learn how to make a good looking app with animation. The basics for the game were easy, but I struggled with the fight for object oriented code that I am used to. It was also not an easy task to look up any documentation for swift. This was very frustrating.

I want to be able to learn things on my own easily with documentation online but found myself unable to find good documentation for most of my questions. I worked for many hours on this, and I enjoyed it, but I would really appreciate comparing ways to do things because sometimes I felt like I had to write hacky solutions because I couldn't find another way to solve a problem.
